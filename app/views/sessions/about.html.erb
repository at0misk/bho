The effects of organization create an undeniable sense of peace and well-being which generally act as a platform for all other aspects of life to flourish. My life journey lead me to discovering this and wanting to share my techniques with the world.</p>
			<p class="about-copy">In 1985 I realized that I had a gift when it came to seeing space where others saw none. I often compare it to a roll of toilet paper- it takes up very little room when it’s neatly wound on the cardboard spool, but can take over an entire room if it’s loose. I began my career with this simple principle in mind and ever since have been able to transform the spaces of clients and students alike, thus saving them all time and money.</p>
			<p class="about-copy">It was in 1991, that I invented the upright folding technique, that many people all over the world now use. Desperate to keep my two year olds drawers neat and tidy, I began to place her folded garments upright. By doing so, I created what I now call the birds eye view.</p>
            <p class="about-copy">My career has expanded to author, keynote speaker, television co-host on a national series, spokesperson for a variety of corporations, consultant, closet design, interior designer, product designer, mover, staging homes for resale, home remodeling, and real estate agent. My business takes me all over the United States, and internationally.</p>
